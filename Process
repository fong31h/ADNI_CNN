My full process from selecting data on the ADNI website to saving model.

1. Using the IDA Advanced Search on the ADNI study website, create an Image Collection of all the MRI scans you want to download.
2. Download the collection, you will have the option to download Meta Data and scan data. Download both.
3. Move zipped folder of scans to working directory, unzip and name. There should be a folder below the parent one called 'ADNI'.
4. Move zipped folder of Meta Data to just created folder. There should now be two folders, the automatically created 'ADNI',
and the new one, which you should rename 'Meta Data'.
5. Run matrix_script.py. This will create all the 2d and 3d matrices for each composite image and each slice, 
and the csv files with the paths and labels.

Using training_loop.py:

6. Run training_loop.py. This should take you through the whole process of training and save the best model and training log.
7. Run testing_loop.py with the model saved from training_loop.py to see accuracy. Be sure to keep the same parameters as when 
training. Use the test split of the data you just trained with.
8. Well done! Now evaluate results....

Using training_loop_separate.py:

6. Use the newly created 2D CSV file with split_dfs.py to save a train_df, validation_df, and test_df to your data directory.
7. Run training_loop_separate.py with train_df, and validation_df. Best model and training log should be saved.
8. Run testing_loop_separate.py with test_df and see the accuracy. Be sure to keep the same parameters as training.
9. Well done! Now evalute results....
